# Overview

I will be analysing a dataset that focuses on the S&P 500. I plan on working on this for two weeks to see what I can get done. This should include some exploration, visualizations, data cleaning, and machine learning. 

Used some data on the stock market to practice some data analysis and machine learning. (link to dataset below)

I definitely learned from this experience. First off, I got some more exposure to using threads and looping through files
in a folder. I also learned more about isolating specific rows and learned about more packages like Swifter to run the apply function in parallel. Lastly, I was able to at least make a vanilla machine learning model to get try to guess the close of each row.

# Development Environment

I will be simply using Visual Studio Code as my text editor for this project. I'll save it on Github and I'll be using Python, Pandas, Altair, numpy, and Sklearn.
